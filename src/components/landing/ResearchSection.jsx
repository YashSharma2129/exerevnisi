          We observed and researched for three years in a variety of <br />students.
          Where the best needs more attention to do better <br />, and the struggling
          students need more attention to improve <br /> their abilities. All students
          need personal attention. Based on <br /> the notion of "Personal attention,"
          we have built our algorithm  <br />and AI tutor to cater to each child uniquely.
